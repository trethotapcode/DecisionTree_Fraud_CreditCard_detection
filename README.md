# DecisionTree_Fraud_CreditCard_detection
"I used a decision tree to analyze and manage a dataset containing nearly 300,000 samples, each sample consisting of around 30 features related to credit cards. The data was labeled, with 0 representing normal cards and 1 representing fraudulent cards. Then, I used the tree_plot and treeviz libraries to visualize the decision tree."
